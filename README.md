# BasicCVFaceDetector

This project provides a simple and foundational implementation for **real-time face and eye detection** using the powerful **OpenCV** library in Python. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the functionality of **Haar Cascade-based object detection algorithms** within the field of **Computer Vision**.

---

## Features:

* **Face Detection:** Identifies and draws bounding boxes around faces in video frames captured from a webcam.
* **Eye Detection:** Identifies and draws bounding boxes around eyes within the detected face regions.
* **Real-time Processing:** Capable of processing and displaying the output instantly.
* **Simplicity & Efficiency:** Utilizes Haar Cascade models for a quick and lightweight implementation.
